# FLOW.md: ultra-powers

> The everything-Flow for an indie founder building, shipping, and growing software. 40 real, hand-verified skills across validate → design → plan → build → debug → verify → review → ship → grow, composed from seven open-source suites (superpowers, compound-engineering, gstack, frontend-design, emil, marketing-skills, claude-seo) — with a routing tree that knows *which* of the overlapping skills to fire.
> Skills by their respective authors (MIT / Apache-2.0, see Attribution). Routing by Flowy.

<!-- The Flowy engine supplies the universal contract (announce, READ/invoke, host-wins,
     post-compaction re-read). This file carries only the routing + disambiguation. -->

## The one rule that makes this Flow worth more than its skills

Five suites overlap on purpose. The Flow's value is knowing which to fire:

- **`superpowers` = portable DISCIPLINES** — laws + gates, no tooling (brainstorming, writing-plans, TDD, systematic-debugging, verification, code-review, worktrees). Reach for these when you want the *guardrail*.
- **`compound-engineering` (`ce-*`) = end-to-end WORKFLOWS** — tooling, sub-agents, auto-fix, tracker ingestion. Reach for these when you want the *machine*.
- **`gstack` = founder-lens REVIEWS + ops** — review a plan/diff through a CEO/eng/DX persona, audit security, generate docs.
- **`claude-seo` owns SEO execution; `marketing-skills` owns GTM.**

**Never fire both halves of a pair on one task.** Pick the lane (discipline *or* workflow), and route by the tiebreakers below.

## Routing

**The rule:** when a trigger matches, INVOKE the named skill BEFORE doing the task yourself. Writing the code, patching the bug, or claiming 'done' without first invoking is the failure this Flow exists to stop.

```

## Disambiguation (the tiebreakers — why this Flow beats loose skills)

**The superpowers ↔ compound-engineering pairs (the law: discipline vs workflow):**
- **office-hours vs ce-ideate** — office-hours validates whether a NEW idea is worth building (demand, wedge). ce-ideate *generates + ranks* what to build/improve next in an EXISTING project. Validate a bet → office-hours; "what's next" → ce-ideate.
- **brainstorming vs ce-brainstorm** — same job, different lane + handoff. `brainstorming` bakes architecture into a design spec and hands to **writing-plans → TDD**. `ce-brainstorm` produces a requirements doc (the WHAT only) and hands to **ce-plan → ce-work**. Pick the lane and stay in it.
- **writing-plans vs ce-plan** — same name, different jobs. `writing-plans` = a TDD-first implementation plan for **code** (actual code + failing-test-first in every step). `ce-plan` = general structured planning (non-code, research-backed, "deepen" mode). Code you'll TDD → writing-plans; anything else → ce-plan.
- **systematic-debugging vs ce-debug** — `systematic-debugging` is the portable root-cause *guardrail* you overlay on any failure (no tooling). `ce-debug` is the full *workflow* — pulls the issue from gh/Linear/Jira, reproduces, fixes end-to-end. ce-debug already contains the discipline; **don't stack them.** Tracker-tied / fix-it-all → ce-debug; stray failure → systematic-debugging.
- **ce-review vs requesting-code-review** — `ce-review` is a 17-persona orchestrated *system* with a confidence gate + auto-fix + headless mode. `requesting-code-review` dispatches ONE reviewer, fast, mid-task. Pre-PR gate / want auto-fix → ce-review; quick eyes → requesting-code-review.
- **verification-before-completion has NO CE twin** — keep it as the done-gate. (CE's `proof` is a markdown editor, not verification; `ce-demo-reel` makes *visual PR proof*, a different job.)

**Plan create vs plan review (a whole phase, not a duplicate):**
- superpowers/CE **create** plans (brainstorming/writing-plans, ce-brainstorm/ce-plan). gstack's **plan-ceo-review / plan-eng-review / plan-devex-review** *review an existing plan* through a persona lens. Different stage of the same loop — create first, then review.

**Design triad (overlap only on "motion"):**
- **frontend-design** = the *look* (aesthetic direction, palette, typography, layout, the signature). **emil-design-eng** = the *feel* (animation craft, easing, springs, micro-interactions). **review-animations** = reviewing motion code (won't auto-fire — only a Flow naming it surfaces it). New UI → frontend-design; make it feel right → emil; audit motion → review-animations.

**Grow — who owns "SEO":**
- **`seo` (claude-seo) owns ALL SEO execution** (audit, technical, schema, AI-Overviews/GEO, backlinks, pages-at-scale) — it's a 25-skill suite behind one router. `marketing-skills` owns broader GTM (positioning, copy, launch, channels). An SEO-specific verb → `seo`; growth strategy where SEO is one channel → marketing. `content-strategy` (marketing, decides *what* to write) and `seo` (is it *optimized*) are complementary, not duplicate.

## Priority on collision

Top-down: 1. **Debug** a broken state. 2. **Verify** a pending "done" claim. 3. **TDD** before writing code. 4. **Plan** before building. 5. **Design** before planning (and **validate/ideate** before design if the bet itself is unsettled). 6. Everything else in lifecycle order. A scope change re-enters the earliest invalidated phase.

## Phases

Validate (office-hours / ce-ideate) → Design (brainstorming|ce-brainstorm + frontend-design/emil) → Plan (writing-plans|ce-plan, then plan-*-review) → Build (TDD|ce-work) → Verify (verification-before-completion) → Review (ce-review / requesting-code-review / review) → Ship (worktrees / git-commit-push-pr / finishing-a-development-branch) → Secure & capture (cso / ce-compound / document-generate / retro / handoff) → Grow (product-marketing first, then GTM + seo).

**Shortcuts:** bug → systematic-debugging → TDD (regression test) → verify. UI feel → emil-design-eng → verify. Ship → git-commit-push-pr. Typo/config → fix → verify.

## You are rationalizing if you think…

- "I'll just design the screen / write the copy myself." → The taste is in the skill (frontend-design / emil / copywriting). Invoke it.
- "ce-debug and systematic-debugging are the same." → One is the machine, one is the guardrail. Pick the lane; don't stack.
- "I know which design skill." → New UI is frontend-design; *feel* is emil; *reviewing* motion is review-animations.
- "I'll verify after." → verification-before-completion. Run the command in THIS message.
- "I'll just ship it." → git-commit-push-pr / finishing-a-development-branch. The PR description and the integration choice matter.
- "The summary says I already routed." → After compaction, re-read this file and restate the phase.
