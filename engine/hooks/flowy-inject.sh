# flowy-inject.sh — Flowy enforcement core (UserPromptSubmit hook)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IT IS
#   A Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` command hook. On every user prompt, Claude
#   Code pipes a flat JSON object on stdin and exports two env vars:
#
#     stdin JSON   { "session_id": "<id>", "prompt": "<text>", ... }
#     env          CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   real project root
#                  CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT   this plugin's install dir
#
#   If a Flowy Flow is active for this session, the hook prints a loud routing
#   banner to stdout. On exit 0, Claude Code injects that stdout into the
#   agent's context — which is how we make routing mandatory.
#
# CONTRACT (non-negotiable)
#   * FAIL-LOUD, NEVER FAIL-CLOSED. The hook ALWAYS exits 0. It NEVER blocks
#     (never exits 2). On ANY error it degrades to a silent no-op. This is the
#     common case: in every normal repo with no Flow active, this script must
#     read stdin, find no state file, and exit 0 with empty stdout.
#   * Emit ONLY the intended banner/warning to stdout. Nothing stray.
#
# STATE FILE SHAPE — schema "flowy-state-v1"
#   Written by the activator unit to the OUT-OF-REPO state dir (see RR2 below):
#     <CLAUDE_HOME>/flowy-state/<project-key>/state-<session_id>.json
#   (or .../state-PENDING.json before a session_id is known). The dir is derived
#   by the shared helper hooks/flowy-paths.sh (flowy_state_dir); see that file for
#   the canonical, path-form-independent key algorithm (0.6.2+).
#
#     {
#       "schema": "flowy-state-v1",
#       "sessionId": "<id>",
#       "activeFlows": [
#         { "name": "superpowers-flow", "flowRef": "flows/superpowers-flow/FLOW.md", "location": "plugin" }
#       ]
#     }
#
#   "location" (optional, RR1): "plugin" (default/absent) resolves the FLOW.md
#   under $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT; "project" resolves it under
#   $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.flowy/flows/<name>/FLOW.md. Parsed positionally with name.
#
#   Deliberately flat so we can parse it with grep/sed and NO jq/python/node.
#   The parser is LINE-ORIENTED: it requires each `"name": "..."` and
#   `"flowRef": "..."` key-value pair to appear on a single line. This holds
#   for minified single-line JSON AND for standard pretty-printed JSON (one
#   key per line). It breaks only if a key is split across lines or a value
#   contains an escaped quote (`\"`) — both of which the activator must avoid.
#   Parsing rules:
#     * "active" = file exists AND contains "activeFlows" AND >=1 "name": entry.
#     * `flowRef` is a CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT-relative path (version-agnostic, NOT
#       an absolute cache path). The live FLOW.md is "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/<ref>.
#     * We read names and flowRefs positionally: the activator writes them in
#       lockstep order (name then flowRef, one pair per array element), so the
#       Nth name pairs with the Nth flowRef.
#
# RESOLUTION + AUTO-REPAIR (per flow)
#   location "project" (RR1):
#     P. Resolve "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.flowy/flows/<name>/FLOW.md" ONLY. No plugin
#        fallback (explicit location must not be silently rescued by a bundled
#        same-named flow). Else → corrupt.
#   location "plugin" / absent:
#     1. Try "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/<flowRef>. If it exists → live.
#     2. Else recompute "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/flows/<name>/FLOW.md. If it exists
#        → live (stale flowRef auto-repaired).
#     3. Else → corrupt (active in state, FLOW.md unresolvable) → loud warning.
#   In ALL cases (RR3) the RESOLVED FLOW.md is rejected if it is a symlink
#   (`[ ! -L ]`) — a planted link must never read an arbitrary file into context.
#
# SECURITY
#   session_id is sanitized against ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$ before it is ever
#   interpolated into a path. Anything else (traversal, metacharacters, empty)
#   → no-op. We never build a path from an untrusted id.
#
# HARDENING (v0.4.1 — ce:review findings)
#   (1) RACE-SAFE PENDING CLAIM. The activator still writes a single shared
#       state-PENDING.json (it cannot know the real session_id — only this hook
#       can). The OLD claim was a check-then-act: `[ ! -f STATE ] && mv PENDING
#       STATE`. Two concurrent sessions in the same dir could both pass the
#       check and race on the single PENDING — one session's flow then silently
#       fails to enforce, or PENDING is claimed by the wrong session.
#       We SERIALIZE the claim with an atomic `mkdir` lock (.flowy/.claim.lock):
#       mkdir is atomic on POSIX (and on networked FS), so exactly one concurrent
#       process wins. The winner does the `mv` and rmdir's the lock; losers skip
#       claiming this turn (a no-op — they retry next prompt, or read their own
#       state-<id>.json if it already exists). A held/stale lock NEVER wedges
#       enforcement: if mkdir fails we simply skip the claim this turn, and the
#       worst case is the flow activates one turn later (fail-loud, never block).
#       The lock is rmdir'd in the same branch that created it AND defensively on
#       the EXIT trap, so a crash mid-claim cannot leave it held forever for the
#       winning process. (A lock left by a hard-killed process is tolerated: the
#       next turn skips claiming once, then a manual /flowy re-activate clears it;
#       we deliberately avoid non-portable POSIX `stat` for stale-age detection.)
#       WHY mkdir over bare atomic mv: same-FS `mv` IS atomic, but the guarding
#       `[ ! -f STATE ]` test before it is not — the lock closes that window.
#   (2) BOUNDED STDIN. We read only the first 32KB of stdin (head -c 32768) instead
#       of slurping an unbounded prompt every turn. session_id sits near the top
#       of Claude Code's JSON, so 32KB contains it comfortably. TRADEOFF: if a
#       future Claude Code build emits the prompt BEFORE session_id and the
#       prompt exceeds 32KB, session_id extraction fails → no-op. That is rare and
#       safe (fail-loud degrades to no enforcement that turn, never a block).
#       32KB safely covers a large prompt preamble before session_id with
#       negligible read cost; if Claude Code ever serializes a >32KB prompt BEFORE
#       session_id, extraction no-ops (safe, rare).
#   (3) BOUNDED STATE FILE. Before `cat`-ing a state file we cap it at 64KB
#       (wc -c). A legit flowy-state-v1 file is well under 1KB; a pathological or
#       corrupt giant file can no longer stall every prompt. Over the cap → no-op.
#   (4) SYMLINK REJECTION. `[ -f ... ]` follows symlinks, so an attacker-planted
#       symlink at the state (or PENDING) path could read an arbitrary file into
#       the agent's context. We add `[ ! -L ... ]`: a symlinked state file → no-op;
#       a symlinked PENDING → claim skipped.
#   (5) flowRef CHARSET ALLOWLIST. Before using a flowRef in a path test we drop
#       any ref containing a char outside [A-Za-z0-9_./-] (so spaces, backslashes,
#       shell metachars, `$(...)`, single-dot oddities are neutered). A dropped
#       ref falls through to name-based auto-repair, exactly like a stale ref.
#   (6) CORRUPT NAMES: newline-separated accumulation + IFS= read -r iteration
#       (dropped the fragile IFS=', ' split that mangled names with dots).
#
# SHELL
#   Runs under Git Bash on Windows (NOT WSL). The repo path contains a space
#   ("Projects VS"), so EVERY path expansion is double-quoted.

# A trap on EXIT forces status 0 even if an unexpected error escapes. We never

# our own lock held. (rmdir of an empty string or non-dir is a harmless no-op.)

#    a future build emits the prompt before session_id and the prompt > 32KB,

#     the hook would otherwise claim it). flowy-paths.sh anchors state under the
#     user's Claude home (<...>/.claude/flowy-state/<project-key>) derived from
#     CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, HARD-REQUIRES a /.claude home, and computes a CANONICAL
#     project-key so the hook, GC, and activator agree byte-for-byte regardless
#     of CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR path form (Windows E:\ vs Git-Bash /e/ — Bug E). It is
#     the SINGLE source of truth; empty output = a no-op condition (no /plugins/,
#     not a .claude home, empty key) → exit 0 (fail-loud, never block). A
#     missing/unsourceable helper also no-ops.

# 3. Claim a PENDING activation, RACE-SAFE (Fix 1). If state-PENDING.json exists
#    and we have a safe id, rename it to state-<id>.json — but serialize the
#    check-then-mv behind an atomic mkdir lock so two concurrent sessions in the
#    same dir can't both claim the single shared PENDING.
#
#    Lock protocol:
#      * `mkdir .claim.lock` is atomic on POSIX; exactly one concurrent process
#        succeeds. The winner sets CLAIM_LOCK (so the EXIT trap also cleans it),
#        performs the guarded mv, then rmdir's the lock immediately.
#      * Losers (mkdir fails) SKIP claiming this turn. That is a safe no-op —
#        they retry next prompt, or read their own state-<id>.json if present.
#      * A held/stale lock therefore never wedges enforcement; worst case the
#        flow activates one turn later. We never block.
#

#    mv an attacker-controlled link target into a session state path.
